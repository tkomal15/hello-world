 # Effective Java Item 1-10
 
 ## ITEM 1: CONSIDER STATIC FACTORY METHODS INSTEAD OF CONSTRUCTORS
 
```java
 public static Boolean valueOf(boolean b) {
    return b ? Boolean.TRUE : Boolean.FALSE;
}
```

> Note that a static factory method is not the same as the Factory Method pattern from Design Patterns

Providing a static factory method instead of a public constructor has both advantages and disadvantages.

- unlike constructors, they can have names. 
- unlike constructors, they are not required to create a new object each time they’re invoked.
- unlike constructors, they can return an object of any subtype of their return type.
- The class of the returned object can vary from call to call as a function of the input parameters.
- The class of the returned object need not exist when the class containing the method is written.

Limitation : 

- The main limitation of providing only static factory methods is that classes without public or protected constructors cannot be subclassed.
- A second shortcoming of static factory methods is that they are hard for programmers to find .

---

## ITEM 2: CONSIDER A BUILDER WHEN FACED WITH MANY CONSTRUCTOR PARAMETERS

Static factories and constructors share a limitation: They do not scale well to large numbers of optional parameters.

What sort of constructors or static factories should you write for such a class? Traditionally, programmers have used the telescoping constructor pattern.

```java
// Telescoping constructor pattern - does not scale well!
public class NutritionFacts {
    private final int servingSize;  // (mL)            required
    private final int servings;     // (per container) required
    private final int calories;     // (per serving)   optional
    private final int fat;          // (g/serving)     optional
    private final int sodium;       // (mg/serving)    optional
    private final int carbohydrate; // (g/serving)     optional

    public NutritionFacts(int servingSize, int servings) {
        this(servingSize, servings, 0);
    }

    public NutritionFacts(int servingSize, int servings,
            int calories) {
        this(servingSize, servings, calories, 0);
    }

    public NutritionFacts(int servingSize, int servings,
            int calories, int fat) {
        this(servingSize, servings, calories, fat, 0);
    }

    public NutritionFacts(int servingSize, int servings,
            int calories, int fat, int sodium) {
        this(servingSize, servings, calories, fat, sodium, 0);
    }

    public NutritionFacts(int servingSize, int servings,
           int calories, int fat, int sodium, int carbohydrate) {
        this.servingSize  = servingSize;
        this.servings     = servings;
        this.calories     = calories;
        this.fat          = fat;
        this.sodium       = sodium;
        this.carbohydrate = carbohydrate;
    }
}
```

The telescoping constructor pattern works, but it is hard to write client code when there are many parameters, and harder still to read it.
A second alternative is -  JavaBeans pattern
 
```java
 // JavaBeans Pattern - allows inconsistency, mandates mutability
public class NutritionFacts {
    // Parameters initialized to default values (if any)
    private int servingSize  = -1; // Required; no default value
    private int servings     = -1; // Required; no default value
    private int calories     = 0;
    private int fat          = 0;
    private int sodium       = 0;
    private int carbohydrate = 0;

    public NutritionFacts() { }
    // Setters
    public void setServingSize(int val)  { servingSize = val; }
    public void setServings(int val)    { servings = val; }
    public void setCalories(int val)    { calories = val; }
    public void setFat(int val)         { fat = val; }
    public void setSodium(int val)      { sodium = val; }
    public void setCarbohydrate(int val) { carbohydrate = val; }
}
NutritionFacts cocaCola = new NutritionFacts();
cocaCola.setServingSize(240);
cocaCola.setServings(8);
cocaCola.setCalories(100);
cocaCola.setSodium(35);
cocaCola.setCarbohydrate(27);
```

---

Limitation :

- Here Construction is split across multiple calls, a JavaBean may be in an inconsistent state partway through its construction. 
It is possible to reduce these disadvantages by manually “freezing” . But it can cause errors at runtime because the compiler cannot ensure 
that the programmer calls the freeze method on an object before using it.

Third Alternative : Builder pattern 


Instead of making the desired object directly, the client calls a constructor (or static factory) with all of the required
parameters and gets a builder object . Then the client calls setter-like methods on the builder object to set each optional parameter of interest. 
Finally, the client calls a parameterless build method to generate the object.

```java
// Builder Pattern
public class NutritionFacts {
    private final int servingSize;
    private final int servings;
    private final int calories;
    private final int fat;
    private final int sodium;
    private final int carbohydrate;

    public static class Builder {
        // Required parameters
        private final int servingSize;
        private final int servings;

        // Optional parameters - initialized to default values
        private int calories      = 0;
        private int fat           = 0;
        private int sodium        = 0;
        private int carbohydrate  = 0;

        public Builder(int servingSize, int servings) {
            this.servingSize = servingSize;
            this.servings    = servings;
        }

        public Builder calories(int val)
            { calories = val;      return this; }
        public Builder fat(int val)
            { fat = val;           return this; }
        public Builder sodium(int val)
            { sodium = val;        return this; }
        public Builder carbohydrate(int val)
            { carbohydrate = val;  return this; }

        public NutritionFacts build() {
            return new NutritionFacts(this);
        }
    }

    private NutritionFacts(Builder builder) {
        servingSize  = builder.servingSize;
        servings     = builder.servings;
        calories     = builder.calories;
        fat          = builder.fat;
        sodium       = builder.sodium;
        carbohydrate = builder.carbohydrate;
    }
}
```
```java
NutritionFacts cocaCola = new NutritionFacts.Builder(240, 8)
        .calories(100).sodium(35).carbohydrate(27).build();

```
- This client code is easy to write and, more importantly, easy to read. 

Disadvantage:

-  The Builder pattern has disadvantages as well. In order to create an object, you must first create its builder. While the cost of creating 
this builder is unlikely to be noticeable in practice, it could be a problem in performance-critical situations.

> In summary, the Builder pattern is a good choice when designing classes whose constructors or static factories would have more than a handful of parameters.
 ---

## TEM 3: ENFORCE THE SINGLETON PROPERTY WITH A PRIVATE CONSTRUCTOR OR AN ENUM TYPE

-  There are two common ways to implement singletons. 
```java
// Singleton with public final field
public class Elvis {
    public static final Elvis INSTANCE = new Elvis();
    private Elvis() { ... }

    public void leaveTheBuilding() { ... }
}
```
```java
// Singleton with static factory
public class Elvis {
    private static final Elvis INSTANCE = new Elvis();
    private Elvis() { ... }
    public static Elvis getInstance() { return INSTANCE; }

    public void leaveTheBuilding() { ... }
}
```
A third way to implement a singleton is to declare a single-element enum:
```java
// Enum singleton - the preferred approach
public enum Elvis {
    INSTANCE;

    public void leaveTheBuilding() { ... }
}
```
A single-element enum type is often the best way to implement a singleton.
>Note : You can’t use this approach if your singleton must extend a superclass other than Enum .

---
## ITEM 4: ENFORCE NONINSTANTIABILITY WITH A PRIVATE CONSTRUCTOR

> Attempting to enforce noninstantiability by making a class abstract does not work. 

A class can be made noninstantiable by including a private constructor:
```java
// Noninstantiable utility class
public class UtilityClass {
    // Suppress default constructor for noninstantiability
    private UtilityClass() {
        throw new AssertionError();
    }
    ... // Remainder omitted
}
```

---
## ITEM 5: PREFER DEPENDENCY INJECTION TO HARDWIRING RESOURCES

Many classes depend on one or more underlying resources. For example, a spell checker depends on a dictionary. 
```java
// Inappropriate use of singleton - inflexible & untestable!
public class SpellChecker {
    private final Lexicon dictionary = ...;

    private SpellChecker(...) {}
    public static INSTANCE = new SpellChecker(...);

    public boolean isValid(String word) { ... }
    public List<String> suggestions(String typo) { ... }
}
```
Static utility classes and singletons are inappropriate for classes whose behavior is parameterized by an underlying resource.

Solution :

- To pass the resource into the constructor when creating a new instance.
This is one form of dependency injection. The dictionary is a dependency of the spell checker and is injected into the spell checker when
it is created.
```java
// Dependency injection provides flexibility and testability
public class SpellChecker {
    private final Lexicon dictionary;

    public SpellChecker(Lexicon dictionary) {
        this.dictionary = Objects.requireNonNull(dictionary);
    }

    public boolean isValid(String word) { ... }
    public List<String> suggestions(String typo) { ... }
}
```

A useful variant of the pattern is to pass a resource factory to the constructor. A factory is an object that can be called repeatedly to create 
instances of a type. 

- Dependency Injection will greatly enhance the flexibility, reusability, and testability of a class.
---

## ITEM 6: AVOID CREATING UNNECESSARY OBJECTS

As an extreme example of what not to do, consider this statement:
```java
String s = new String("icecream");  // DON'T DO THIS!

String s = "icecream"; //CORRECT
```
- You can often avoid creating unnecessary objects by using static factory methods .
- If you’re going to need such an “expensive object” repeatedly, it may be advisable to cache it for reuse.


1. Suppose you want to write a method to determine whether a string is a valid Roman numeral. 
```java
// Performance can be greatly improved!
static boolean isRomanNumeral(String s) {
    return s.matches("^(?=.)M*(C[MD]|D?C{0,3})"
            + "(X[CL]|L?X{0,3})(I[XV]|V?I{0,3})$");
}
```
To improve the performance, explicitly compile the regular expression into a Pattern instance (which is immutable) as part of class initialization, cache it.
```java
// Reusing expensive object for improved performance
public class RomanNumerals {
    private static final Pattern ROMAN = Pattern.compile(
            "^(?=.)M*(C[MD]|D?C{0,3})"
            + "(X[CL]|L?X{0,3})(I[XV]|V?I{0,3})$");

    static boolean isRomanNumeral(String s) {
        return ROMAN.matcher(s).matches();
    }
}
```
> Autoboxing blurs but does not erase the distinction between primitive and boxed primitive types.

- Consider the following method, which calculates the sum of all the positive int values
```java
// Hideously slow! Can you spot the object creation?
private static long sum() {
    Long sum = 0L;
    for (long i = 0; i <= Integer.MAX_VALUE; i++)
        sum += i;

    return sum;
}
```
> Whats wrong here ? Long or long ?

> prefer primitives to boxed primitives, and watch out for unintentional autoboxing.

- Conversely, avoiding object creation by maintaining your own object pool is a bad idea unless the objects in the pool are extremely heavyweight. The classic example of an object that does justify an object pool is a database connection. 

---
## ITEM 7: ELIMINATE OBSOLETE OBJECT REFERENCES

Consider the following simple stack implementation:
```java
// Can you spot the "memory leak"?
public class Stack {
    private Object[] elements;
    private int size = 0;
    private static final int DEFAULT_INITIAL_CAPACITY = 16;

    public Stack() {
        elements = new Object[DEFAULT_INITIAL_CAPACITY];
    }

    public void push(Object e) {
        ensureCapacity();
        elements[size++] = e;
    }

    public Object pop() {
        if (size == 0)
            throw new EmptyStackException();
        return elements[--size];
    }

    /**
     * Ensure space for at least one more element, roughly
     * doubling the capacity each time the array needs to grow.
     */
    private void ensureCapacity() {
        if (elements.length == size)
            elements = Arrays.copyOf(elements, 2 * size + 1);
    }
}
```
Loosely speaking, the program has a “memory leak,” . In extreme cases, such memory leaks can cause disk paging and even program failure with an OutOfMemoryError, but such failures are relatively rare.

> So where is the memory leak? 

- The stack maintains obsolete references to the poped out  objects. An obsolete reference is simply a reference that will never be dereferenced again. 
- In this case, any references outside of the “active portion” of the element array are obsolete. The active portion consists of the elements whose index is less than size.

> Null out references once they become obsolete. Nulling out object references should be the exception rather than the norm. 
```java
public Object pop() {
    if (size == 0)
        throw new EmptyStackException();
    Object result = elements[--size];
    elements[size] = null; // Eliminate obsolete reference
    return result;
}
```
- Another common source of memory leaks is caches.
- A third common source of memory leaks is listeners and other callbacks. 

Solution 

One way to ensure that cache items and callbacks are garbage collected promptly is to store only weak references to them, for instance, by storing them only as keys in a WeakHashMap.

---
## ITEM 8: AVOID FINALIZERS AND CLEANERS

> Finalizers are unpredictable, often dangerous, and generally unnecessary. As a rule, you should avoid them.

As of Java 9, finalizers have been deprecated, but they are still being used by the Java libraries. The Java 9 replacement for finalizers is cleaners. 

> Cleaners are less dangerous than finalizers, but still unpredictable, slow, and generally unnecessary.

- Never depend on a finalizer or cleaner to update persistent state. May bring your entire distributed system to a grinding halt.
- Another problem with finalizers is that an uncaught exception thrown during finalization is ignored, and finalization of that object terminates.
- Finalizers have a serious security problem: they open your class up to finalizer attacks.
  * If an exception is thrown from a constructor,  the finalizer of a malicious subclass can run on the partially constructed object that should have “died on the vine.” This finalizer can record a reference to the object in a static field, preventing it from being garbage collected. 

>Throwing an exception from a constructor should be sufficient to prevent an object from coming into existence, in the presence of finalizers, it is not.

- Solution
   * To protect nonfinal classes from finalizer attacks, write a final finalize method that does nothing.
   * Have your class implementAutoCloseable, and require its clients to invoke the close method on each instance when it is no longer needed . 

 ```java
   // An autocloseable class using a cleaner as a safety net 
 public class Room implements AutoCloseable {
    private static final Cleaner cleaner = Cleaner.create();

    // Resource that requires cleaning. Must not refer to Room!
    private static class State implements Runnable {
        int numJunkPiles; // Number of junk piles in this room

        State(int numJunkPiles) {
            this.numJunkPiles = numJunkPiles;
        }

        // Invoked by close method or cleaner
        @Override public void run() {
            System.out.println("Cleaning room");
            numJunkPiles = 0;
        }
    }

    // The state of this room, shared with our cleanable
    private final State state;

    // Our cleanable. Cleans the room when it’s eligible for gc
    private final Cleaner.Cleanable cleanable;

    public Room(int numJunkPiles) {
        state = new State(numJunkPiles);
        cleanable = cleaner.register(this, state);
    }

    @Override public void close() {
        cleanable.clean();
    }
}
```
```java
//Example 1
public class Adult {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try (Room myRoom = new Room(7)) {
            System.out.println("Goodbye");
        }
    }
}
```
Running the Adult program prints Goodbye, followed by Cleaning room.
```java
//Example 2
public class Teenager {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        new Room(99);
        System.out.println("Peace out");
    }
}
```
You might expect it to print Peace out, followed by Cleaning room, but on my machine, it never prints Cleaning room; it just exits. This is the unpredictability we spoke of earlier. The Cleaner spec says, “The behavior of cleaners during System.exit is implementation specific. No guarantees are made relating to whether cleaning actions are invoked or not.”

---
## ITEM 9: PREFER TRY-WITH-RESOURCES TO TRY-FINALLY
```java
// try-finally is ugly when used with more than one resource!
static void copy(String src, String dst) throws IOException {
    InputStream in = new FileInputStream(src);
    try {
        OutputStream out = new FileOutputStream(dst);
        try {
            byte[] buf = new byte[BUFFER_SIZE];
            int n;
            while ((n = in.read(buf)) >= 0)
                out.write(buf, 0, n);
        } finally {
            out.close();
        }
    } finally {
        in.close();
    }
}

```
> All of these problems were solved in one fell swoop when Java 7 introduced the try-with-resources statement . To be usable with this construct, a resource must implement the AutoCloseable interface .

```java
//Example
// try-with-resources - the the best way to close resources!
static String firstLineOfFile(String path) throws IOException {
    try (BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader( new FileReader(path))) {
       return br.readLine();
    }
}
```
```java
// try-with-resources with a catch clause
static String firstLineOfFile(String path, String defaultVal) {
    try (BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(path))) {
        return br.readLine();
    } catch (IOException e) {
        return defaultVal;
    }
}
```
> Always use try-with-resources in preference to try-finally when working with resources that must be closed. 

---
##  ITEM 10: OBEY THE GENERAL CONTRACT WHEN OVERRIDING EQUALS

The easiest way to avoid problems is not to override the equals method other then the IDE .

 When not to override :
- Each instance of the class is inherently unique.
- There is no need for the class to provide a “logical equality” test.
- A superclass has already overridden equals, and the superclass behavior is appropriate for this class.
- The class is private or package-private, and you are certain that its equals method will never be invoked.


When you override the equals method, you must adhere to its general contract :

- Reflexive: For any non-null reference value x, x.equals(x) must return true.

- Symmetric: For any non-null reference values x and y, x.equals(y) must return true if and only if y.equals(x) returns true.

- Transitive: For any non-null reference values x, y, z, if x.equals(y) returns true and y.equals(z) returns true, then x.equals(z) must return true.

- Consistent: For any non-null reference values x and y, multiple invocations of x.equals(y) must consistently return true or consistently return false, provided no information used in equalscomparisons is modified.

 > Do not write an equals method that depends on unreliable resources.

 - For any non-null reference value x, x.equals(null) must return false.

```java
// Broken - violates symmetry!
public final class CaseInsensitiveString {
    private final String s;

    public CaseInsensitiveString(String s) {
        this.s = Objects.requireNonNull(s);
    }

    // Broken - violates symmetry!
    @Override public boolean equals(Object o) {
        if (o instanceof CaseInsensitiveString)
            return s.equalsIgnoreCase(
                ((CaseInsensitiveString) o).s);
        if (o instanceof String)  // One-way interoperability!
            return s.equalsIgnoreCase((String) o);
        return false;
    }
    ...  // Remainder omitted
}

CaseInsensitiveString cis = new CaseInsensitiveString("Polish");
String s = "polish";

cis.equals(s) returns true. 

s.equals(cis) returns false

```
here’s a recipe for a high-quality equals method:

-	Use the == operator to check if the argument is a reference to this object.
-	Use the instanceof operator to check if the argument has the correct type.
-   Cast the argument to the correct type.
-	For each “significant” field in the class, check if that field of the argument matches the corresponding field of this object.
